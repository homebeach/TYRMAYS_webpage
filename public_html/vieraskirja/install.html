<h1>egbook 2.0 Help File</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Thank you for downloading egbook! This help file will explain to you what egbook does 
and how you can customise it completely so that it integrates seamlessly into your website.</p>

<p>egbook is a guestbook script written in PHP. It stores the entries in text files, so you 
do not need a database to use it.</p>

<p>egbook allows you to have as many fields as you want. You can also make as many of them 
mandatory so that users must fill these fields in.</p>

<p>egbook can be completely customised. It comes with code for you to use so that you can 
display the entry form and the entries anywhere you want on the page. This allows egbook
to completely follow your website's design.</p>

<p>egbook also supports smileys. You can use your own custom set of smileys, but egbook
comes with a set that I made.</p>

<p>On top of all of this, egbook is free for noncommercial use. Commercial users, please 
see below - egbook is very affordable!</p>

<p>Now onto the installation.... thanks again for using egbook! If you get stuck, please
contact me; the details are found below.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Before we start: folders and directories are exactly the same thing. I will use them 

<p class="EmRed">Note that you cannot upgrade from version 1.0 of egbook. Please install a fresh
copy of egbook. This is because a lot of the new features are not compatible with the old 
version. Sorry!</p>
interchangeably.</p>
<p>egbook comes as a ZIP file distribution. Please visit the 
<a href="http://ekstreme.com/phplabs/egbook.php">egbook home page</a> to make sure you are using the latest
version</p>

<p>Unzip the file to somewhere on your computer. You will get a folder called egbook. 
Inside this folder, there are 2 folders and several files.</p>

<p>If you want to use the default egbook installation (i.e., you do not want any customisations), just upload 
this whole folder to your web space. If you want to customise egbook, please read the sections below first.</p>

<p>The next step, find inside your egbook installation folder a folder called 'entries'. It is inside the data
folder. Unless you are using a Windows server, you need to set the permissions for the entries folder to be 
666. How you do this varies with the FTP program you are using. Look for a command called 'permissions' or 
CHMOD.</p>

<p>Now your installation is complete! You can rename the egbook folder to something more useful, like 'guestbook'.
If you use egbook, please drop me a message using the details below - I would love to take a look at your guestbook!</p>

<h2>Customisation</h2>

<p>egbook has several customisation features. To use it to the full potential, please read this section carefully.
Some customisations are more difficult than others, but they are straightforward. If you need help, please 
contact me using the details below.</p>

<h3>Smileys</h3>
<p>The easiest thing to customise is the smiley set that comes with egbook. Inside the icons folder (in your
egbook folder), you will find a file for each smiley that egbook supports. Make your own and replace the 
corresponding icon(s) in that folder.</p>

<h3>Fields</h3>
<p>One of the most powerful features of egbook is that it allows you an unlimited number of fields that you 
define. That is, there are no hard-coded fields: You can define the fields and their names, and egbook will 
work with all of them! Further, you can make as many of these fields mandatory, and egbook will not save an 
entry unless all mandatory fields are filled in.</p>

<p>These features are very easy to use though! I will now describe how to define your fields, and then how 
to make them mandatory.</p>

<p>Inside your egbook folder, there is another folder called 'data'. Inside that you will find a file called
'fieldlist.txt'. Open this file using a text editor. Under Windows, Notepad will do. Under Linux, anything like
gedit, vi, or emacs will do. If you want a good webmaster's text editor, you can see 
<a href="http://ekstreme.com/digitalsmoke/freeware.php">my list of recommended freeware</a>.</p>

<p>The fieldlist.txt file contains the field names, one per line. For example, if you want a field that users
type in their height, type in on a separate line the word 'Height' (no quotes). <span class="EmRed">Careful: The field names
are case sensitive!</span>. Type in/remove as many fields as you want (but read on...)</p>

<p>To make a field mandatory, you simply add an asterisk at the end of the name. For example, to force users to 
type in their height, type in on a separate line 'Height*' (no quotes). You can make as many fields as you want
mandatory.</p>

<p>However, not all fields are equal in the eyes of egbook. There are three field names that are special. These are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Email</li>
	<li>URL</li>
	<li>Comment</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note that the names are case sensitive!)</p>

<p>Why are they special? Because when egbook encounters and Email or a URL field, it turns it into an HTML link. Further
URL fields are checked to see if they have the http:// prefix (actually, egbook checks for any protocol). If not, 
one is added to make the link valid!</p>
<p>The Comment field is special because when egbook finds a Comment field, it displays a textarea in the entry
form. This allows users to type in multiple lines.</p>

<p>This is the only difference between these three fields and the other fields. To make any of them mandatory,
just add the asterisk as described above.</p>

<p>Finally, just to make sure you know what is going: To display the entry form, egbook reads the fieldlist.txt file
and then displays a field input for each one. If it finds a Comment field, egbook displays a textarea.</p>

<h2>Website Integration</h2>
<p>egbook can be made to integrate into your website as much as you want. If you do not want any form of 
integration, then the default index.php file that comes with egbook will do the job for you.</p>

<p>egbook allows you to control the following aspects completely:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Where, inside your HTML, to display the egbook entry form</li>
	<li>Where, inside your HTML, to display your guestbook's entries</li>
	<li>How the egbook entry form and entries look when displayed</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I will describe how to use each of those features. egbook works best if 
the same PHP page is used to display the entry form and the entries. Also, this
page is best left in the egbook installation folder. However, with 
little or no tinkering, you can separate these into different pages if you want. Please
contact me if you want more help with this.</p>

<h3>Entry Form and Entries List</h3>
<p>To display the entry form and entries, use the following code:</p>

<div class="code">&lt;php<br />require &quot;egbook.php&quot;;<br />
require &quot;egbookform.php&quot;;<br />require &quot;egbookdisplayentries.php&quot;;<br />?&gt;</div>

<p>This bit of code will display the entry form immediately followed by the entries list.</p>

<p>Before describing how to separate them, notice the first require statement. <span class="EmRed">Before
you can display the entry form or the entries, you need to have this statement in your PHP page.</span></p>

<p>The next line in the above code displays the entry form. You can move that line to wherever you want in 
your PHP page.</p>

<p>Likewise, to display the entries, use the last require line above.</p>
<p>Note that the above code example assumes that the page that is displaying the guestbook is found inside 
the folder where you installed egbook. If not, then the statements will have to change: instead of using 
the filename as per above, you need to type in the full path to the file.</p>

<h3>egbook CSS File</h3>
<p>The last thing to customise is how egbook looks like. Everything is controlled using a cascading style 
sheet (CSS) file. Inside the egbook folder, there are two CSS files; the one that you should edit is the 
'egbook.css' file. Please do not edit the other one, as it controls how this installation file is displayed!</p>

<p>Open the 'egbook.css' file using a text editor and edit the CSS as you see fit. There are some comments in there
to guide you. If you get stuck, take a look at the HTML that egbook outputs (view the source of your guestbook page), 
and you will get lots of information. If you still need more help, please contact me.</p>
