PLEASE NOTE - If you want to use smileys in your guestbook, the default
settings allow you to use the smileys from our site for a short while. 
As this puts an extra load on our bandwidth you should the images in 
smileys.zip included with this script or download our smileys from

www.active-scripts.net/smileys/smileys.zip

and put them on your own site. You will then need to change the urls in
the Smiley Manager.

Please do this as soon as possible.


THE SMILEY.ZIP FILE ALSO CONTAINS URL AND EMAIL LINK IMAGES.
