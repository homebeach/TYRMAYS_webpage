From version 14.3, you can use captcha images on your
own server instead of taking them from our site.

Captcha images are the numbers that appear in the 
preview page when a guest tries to add a message. By
default, the guestbook pulls these images from our site,
but if for some reason our site is unavailable, your
guests won't be able to add messages to your guestbook.

The file captcha.zip contains the images you need. Put 
them into a directory of your choice on your server (don't
put them under cgi-bin as many servers won't allow this) 
and edit A16 and A17 in the Standard Preferences Manager.

You don't need to do any of this if you just wish to
continue using captcha images from our site. All other
images such as smileys etc. MUST be moved onto your
own site. This is done in the Color Preferences Manager.
