Once you have successfully installed this script, there are a few
things you really MUST do first...

1 - Remember the url of the Control Panel. You can get to the control
Panel by adding ?action=control_panel to the end of the address
of your guestbook, e.g.
http://www.yoursite.com/cgi-bin/gb/guestbook.cgi?action=control_panel

2 - Go to the Control Panel and click on Standard Preferences Manager.

3 - Scroll down to section D2 and enter your email address. DO THIS NOW!!

4 - Go to D5 and enter the name of your guestbook.

5 - Go to D6 and enter the text you wish to go to users you add messages.

6 - Go to section 6 and enter your backup preferences

7 - Go to section B1 and choose which fields you would like to use.

8 - THIS BIT IS IMPORTANT - Go to section A and set up your preferences.
This is important because of the amount of spam that is currently being
added to guestbooks. A1 requires users to confirm their messages via email.
You might find this very useful in stopping spam. A3 allows you to block
urls in messages. This is VERY useful in blocking spam as most spammers
simply want to leave the address of a website on your guestbook. A4 stops
bots from harvesting emails from your site.

9 - You can now go through the rest of the settings in Standard Preferences
Manager. After this, you should go back to the Control Panel and go to the 
Language Preferences Manager to change the text that appears in the 
guestbook.

10 - Go to the Password Manager and change your password.

Enjoy.
